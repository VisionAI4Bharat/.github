VisionAI4Bharat

🌍 Open Vision AI for Bharat, by Bharat.
Free (as in free speech) models, datasets, and tools for research, industry, and society.

🌟 Mission

VisionAI4Bharat is a community-driven initiative to build open, transparent, and accessible Vision AI models tailored for the diverse needs of India.
We believe AI should not be locked away behind paywalls or licenses—it should be free, collaborative, and empowering.

🎯 Goals

🧠 Develop and share open-source Vision AI models (detection, classification, OCR, tracking, etc.)

🌾 Apply AI to real-world Indian contexts (agriculture, mobility, healthcare, accessibility, manufacturing)

🔤 Support multilingual and multicultural datasets relevant to Bharat

🤝 Foster cross-sector collaboration between researchers, students, startups, and industries

🕊️ Uphold the values of freedom, openness, and community research
